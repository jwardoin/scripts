**This is my first bash script**

It is used to either add or remove a user:
1. Use add or remove as your first command line argument
2. enter a username as second command line argument
3. enter a password as third command line argument
	- if left blank, a random password will be generated

After creation of an account:
1. email is send to username@companyname.com with a text file provide username and password
2. For safety, the above mentioned text file is deleted from the system
3. a text file with company rules is placed in the user's home directory
